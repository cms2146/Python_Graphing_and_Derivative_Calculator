Hello!
The documentation in the current version of the code should be pretty extensive, but feel free to ask me any question you may have.
The code currently requires Numpy and matplotlib to function, and I'm trying to write a script to install those if not present, but matplotlib is being annoying, so if anybody can help with that it's be appreciated.
Any questions or comments can be send to my email at cms2146@rit.edu
Thanks for checking out my project!
